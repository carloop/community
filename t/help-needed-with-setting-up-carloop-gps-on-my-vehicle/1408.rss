    <title>Help Needed with Setting Up Carloop GPS on My Vehicle</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/help-needed-with-setting-up-carloop-gps-on-my-vehicle/1408</link>
    <description>Hello guys! :saluting_face:

I am trying to get my Carloop GPS up and running in my car, but I&#39;m stuck!  No matter what I try, I can&#39;t seem to get a signal.

**Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done so far:**

* Plugged the Carloop thingy (is that what it&#39;s called?) into the OBD-II port in my car.
* Downloaded the Carloop library onto my Particle device (hope I did that right!).
* Uploaded the sample GPS code to the device (fingers crossed!).
* Checked the Particle console for GPS info, but it&#39;s blank.
* Double-checked everything, and the device seems connected, but the GPS data is missing in action.

I also check this: [https://carloop.dyndns.org/t/help-with-carloop-code-reader-app](https://carloop.dyndns.org/t/help-with-carloop-code-reader-app/415)[salesforce-dev](https://www.igmguru.com/salesforce/salesforce-developer-training/) But I have not found any solution. Anyone else ever face this issue?  Maybe I&#39;m missing something super simple?  Any troubleshooting tips from the experts would be a lifesaver!

Thanks in advance
