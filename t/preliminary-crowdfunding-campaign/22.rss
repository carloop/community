    <description>We are working with Crowd Supply, a crowdfunding site with a focus on open-source projects, to bring the Carloop devkit to production.

As the beginning of the campaign gets nearer we will update this post with more information.</description>

            <p>Specs please, I can see serious effort into making this, but on the store page looking to make an impulse buy I should be able to tell:</p>
<p>There are different Electron models 2G and two 3G, the picture shows a U260 which is Americas/Aus 3G. On the Electron page it says “We offer two types of Electron 3G Kits” but there isn’t a selection. Confirmation?</p>
<p>It seems like the GPS module is the GP-635T, how does it preform deployed under the dash? If not great, then a uFL  breakout as well would be nice. A smarter person than I would be able to use the GPS data, and calibrate a magnetometer and then use it for directional information, not sure the value is there for everyone.</p>
<p>A battery to ‘retain the satellite data’ to help with GPS fix times.</p>
<p>Better Carloop library documentation and marketing, I can look at the code and kinda see what it does. Engine error code explanations, RPM, engine temperature etc. example getEngineCoolantTemp();</p>
<p>Would the Asset Tracker I have be able to work? I haven’t looked at what pins are used.</p>
<p>An accelerometer.</p>
<p>An example trip logging project.</p>
<p>For your consideration, thanks!</p>
