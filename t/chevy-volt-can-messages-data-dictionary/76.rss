    <title>Chevy Volt CAN messages data dictionary</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/chevy-volt-can-messages-data-dictionary/76</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with a Chevy Volt and thanks to the [Simple CAN Logger] (https://github.com/carloop/simple_logger) by @jvanier was able to access all CAN messages and logged them on a text file.

Getting all CAN messages can be overwhelming not only for you but for the TCP server and the serial port.  For this reason, it&#39;s best to limit the range of messages you are looking for.   For e.g. from 0x100 to 0x200. 

In the case of the Chevy Volt, I believe @fonix would be very happy to know that there is list started with some interesting available variables on the CAN bus.  The list can be found here: http://evtools.info/ChevyVoltOBD2CAN.html

I&#39;ll post an example on this topic, since I will try to map as many CAN messages to physical values as I can find on the Chevy Volt.</description>
