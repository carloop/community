    <title>Question on Fuel Trim calculation for PID&#39;s 6-9</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/question-on-fuel-trim-calculation-for-pids-6-9/865</link>
    <description>Hello. I am trying to figure out which one of two formulas to calculate the Fuel trim is correct for PID&#39;s 6-9.  In various sources I find fuelTrim = (100/128)A - 100.  In other sources I find  fuelTrim=A/1.28 - 100.  And in additional sources, I find both ways as options.  Since (A/1.28)-100 is not equal to (100/128)A-100, which formula is correct? Am I missing a key piece of info here that will help me determine which formula is correct or show that both are correct?  Thanks in advance for your feedback.</description>
