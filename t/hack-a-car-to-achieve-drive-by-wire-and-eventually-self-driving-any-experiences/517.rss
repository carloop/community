    <title>Hack a car to achieve drive-by-wire and eventually self-driving? Any experiences?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/hack-a-car-to-achieve-drive-by-wire-and-eventually-self-driving-any-experiences/517</link>
    <description>Hi guys. There is a self-driving development platform hackathon for car drive-by-wire hacking https://www.pixmoving.com/move-it

Hacking include: 
● Hacking of car control, both lateral and longitudinal controls, to achieve drive-by-wire 
● Self-driving setup and test of 1/16 scale car powered by Raspberry Pi 
● Installation and test run of open source self-driving software on full-sized car

Prizes and reimburse offered for the outcomes. Looks very promising and cool. The relevant skills would be a plus. Anyone interested?
