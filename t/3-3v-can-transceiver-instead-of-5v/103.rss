    <title>3.3V CAN transceiver instead of 5v?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/3-3v-can-transceiver-instead-of-5v/103</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anyone has  researched using 3.3V CAN transceiver instead of 5v? I saves the 5V regulator (around $1.5 in BOM).

I ended up using sn65hvd233 from TI. any experience with sn65hvd233?

Thanks,

            <p>I just used the 3.3V power supply since this chip does not require a 5V supply. I donâ€™t think Particle outputs a 5V line. I wanted to avoid an extra power regulator. The schematic is fairly straightforward from the datasheet:</p>

<p>I used split termination with two 60 ohm resistors.</p>
<p>I have not tested the board yet, as I am having a prototype built. Will keep you posted on the end result.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://community.carloop.io/u/mehrdad">@mehrdad</a> would be cool to see how you did that with a schematic.  I recall you need the 5V regulator to power the Particle boards.  Is that the 5V regulator you are referring to?</p>
