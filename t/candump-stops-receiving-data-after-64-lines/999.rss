    <title>Candump stops receiving data after 64 lines</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/candump-stops-receiving-data-after-64-lines/999</link>
    <description>Was finally able to setup my carloop with particle photon.
First carloop was defective and had to replace.  Now the replacement is working.

Hello world LED blinking works
VIN Reader works

Followed all of the instructions here: https://www.carloop.io/apps/app-socketcan/

Problem comes when running candump can0

On my 2018 Nissan, 64 lines of output come right when turning on the ignition, then nothing else.  All of the IDs are 71D 72D 71F 72F.

On my 2012 Nissan, constant output is received as expected.

Per this website (at the bottom https://harrisonsand.com/can-on-the-raspberry-pi/) it looks like there could be a gateway / firewall in my vehicle preventing code output?

Any thoughts?</description>

            <p>I gave up after the block above in February.</p>
<p>Can you provide more specifics about how to “send an OBD query message?”</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Not sure if you’re still having issues, but you might need to send an OBD query message to get a response.</p>
