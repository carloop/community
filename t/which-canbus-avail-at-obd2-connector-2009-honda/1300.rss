    <title>Which CANbus avail at OBD2 connector 2009 Honda</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/which-canbus-avail-at-obd2-connector-2009-honda/1300</link>
    <description>I want to receive/transmit lock and unlock codes to my 2009 Honda Accord.

I have plugged into the CANbus at the OBD2 connector and am successfully reading CAN frames.  However, I&#39;m not capturing any lock/lock codes.

I read [on this post](https://carloop.dyndns.org/t/honda-b-can-and-carloop/152) that there are 2 CAN busses on the Honda&#39;s, bridged through a gateway module.  SO my questions are:

1. Which CAN bus (F or B) am I connecting to at the OBD2 connector?  Since my speed is 500k on the bus I assume F.
2. How can I ask the gateway to bridge lock codes (send and receive) across the busses?
3. If #2 is not possible, how can I (easily) connect to the CAN-B on this car?  I say in the other post that an Odysey owner jumpered into CAN-B at a car heater module...but hoping for something easier or under-dash.</description>
