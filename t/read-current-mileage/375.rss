    <description>I am looking for a possibility to get a trigger the current colometer stand. Unfortunately, I have not found a PID which can be used. How can I do this with a Carloop and Particle Electron, does anyone have an idea?</description>

<p>There is no PID for the odometer in the OBD or OBD-II standard specification.<br>
It might be there as a custom PID for your car, or done using another message format, or maybe done on a whole other bus (or not at all, but I doubt that).</p>
<p>I would suggest searching for a forum that specializes in your type of car.<br>
Let us know what type of car you have; maybe someone here can point you where to go.<br>
Once you find a group that knows your car, you can ask or search there.</p>
<p>Then, once you know how it is done on your car, then we can help you out programming your Carloop to do it.</p>
<p>Good luck searching!</p>
