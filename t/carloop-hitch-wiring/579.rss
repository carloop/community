    <title>Carloop hitch wiring</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/carloop-hitch-wiring/579</link>
    <description>I just received my hitch and I&#39;m assuming how can I wire the hitch and just want to validate with you guys if that is correct:

The hitch has 2 (green) connectors with High and Low each of them. I just need to conect any of (H/L) them to my OBD adapter? or it is a spacial wiring that I have to do ?

Thanks.</description>

            <p>Great. Actually I’m just waiting for the Carloop adapter, but the hitch just arrived earlier (I dont know why was sent separately).<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>It is just a simple matter of connecting the H &amp; L lines to your CANbus.<br>
The easy location to connect to the main CANbus is at the OBD adapter.  However, that is exactly what the regular Carloop was designed for.</p>
<p>The beauty of the CAN hitch is that you can wire it into other CANbus that may be on your car.<br>
For example, most modern Jeeps have a secondary CANbus that has no adapter port; people have discovered they can hook into it through the wiring behind the car radio. CAN hitch is perfect for this scenario. This gets access to a whole lot of communications that never show up at the OBD adapter.</p>
<p>Have fun hitching up!</p>
