    <title>Carloop Pro - No GPS Fix</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/carloop-pro-no-gps-fix/928</link>
    <description>Hey there,

I have the [Carloop Pro](https://store.carloop.io/products/carloop-pro-1) and &#39;m having troubles getting a GPS fix simliar to that of many other threads here. I&#39;m running the unedited [carloop-minimal](https://github.com/carloop/carloop-library/blob/master/examples/carloop_minimal/carloop_minimal.cpp) code on OS 1.4.0 and despite being outside on a clear day for 30 minutes, I can&#39;t aquire a GPS status.

It seems like using an external antenna or using jumper wires on the JST-SH ports wouldn&#39;t be optimal for my situation. Are there any other easy ways to debug this? How can I tell if the boards are bad? Any direction is appreciated.

Thanks!</description>
