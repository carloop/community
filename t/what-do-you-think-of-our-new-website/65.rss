            <p>re: case, I’m with you on that one =&gt; coming sooner than you think!</p>
<p>Would be great to get some feedback (and help <img src="//carloop-community.dyndns.org/images/emoji/twitter/nerd.png?v=12" title=":nerd:" class="emoji" alt=":nerd:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">) on the docs.  Where did you get stuck at the beginning?  How can Getting Started with Carloop be better explained?  The more contributors we can help get started, the higher number of CAN IDs we’ll have mapped to physical values.  That’s the goal!</p>

            <p>Great starting point for the docs! As far as the store, would you consider adding some sort of nice plastic case for the Carloop? Right now I’m using some cheap Chinese ELM case to fit the whole thing. Looks pretty ugly <img src="//carloop-community.dyndns.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://community.carloop.io/u/izeroman">@Izeroman</a>, we’ve added some documentation on the website to get the ball rolling.  We are using a platform called <a href="http://readme.io">readme.io</a> that allows anyone to edit documentation.  See: <a href="http://carloop.io">carloop.io</a></p>
<p>Also, we’ve added a brand new store at <a href="https://store.carloop.io">store.carloop.io</a> =&gt; a work in progress but really curious what you think of these new additions.</p>

            <p>A lot better than the old one. My suggestion is to add ‘docs’ and ‘tutorials/examples’ as well as ‘project shares’ sections to your website.</p>
