    <description>I am brand new to carloop, CAN sniffing, to etc. I have a carloop basic and would like to stay capturing CAN traffic on my 2015 Silverado. Despite connecting via the particle WiFi and USB cable, I cannot figure out how to get my raspberry pi 3 to recognize it in a way to allow me to capture can traffic. Any help is really appreciated.</description>
