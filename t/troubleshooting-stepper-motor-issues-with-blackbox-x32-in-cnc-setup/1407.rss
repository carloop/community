    <title>Troubleshooting Stepper Motor Issues with Blackbox X32 in CNC Setup</title>

    <description>Hi everyone, :saluting_face:

I was recently working on a CNC project and using a Blackbox X32 controller along with Nema 23 stepper motors. I&#39;m experiencing some issues with the setup and could use some advice from those who have experience with similar configurations.
Here are the specifics of my setup:
* Blackbox X32 controller
* Nema 23 stepper motors

But I am facing some specific issues like:
1. Sometimes the motors skip steps or move erratically.
2. The motors and controller seem to get quite hot after a short period of operation.
3. There&#39;s a lot of noise from the motors during operation, which I suspect might be due to improper tuning.

I have tried adjusting the current settings on the Blackbox X32 and checking all connections, but the problems persist. Has anyone else encountered similar issues or have any tips on how to resolve them? Are there specific settings or configurations I should be aware of for this setup?

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</description>
