    <title>GPS Fix Inconsistency Issue</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/gps-fix-inconsistency-issue/796</link>
    <description>Hello,
I have a Carloop with the GPS module. At times it gets a fix very quickly when there is open sky at other times it never gets a fix. The question I have is would it be possible to program the Carloop to retry the gps connection until a fix is obtained?
Thanks!</description>
