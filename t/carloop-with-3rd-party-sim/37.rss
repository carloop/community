    <description>Particle sims won&#39;t work in my area. So I use 3rd party sim and what interesting is it requires some sort of ping to keep cellular and Particle cloud connected. This loops updates once every 40 secs. I tried putting the Electron on the Carloop without publishing any data, it&#39;s still very hot.</description>

            <p>In the meantime, what would you suggest those of us who own current board version?</p>

            <p>At this point it looks like the power supply circuit will need to be modified in a future board revision.</p>

            <p>I can confirm that the Electron with Particle.keepAlive(45); with Carloop-minimal sketch (no gps unit connected) does produce an unbearable heat on the Carloop unit.</p>

            <p>If you want to send a quick ping to the server every 40 seconds, you can use <code>Particle.keepAlive(40);</code> starting with system firmware 0.5.0. The Particle SIM only needs a ping every 23 minutes. You can play around with different numbers to see what works best for you.</p>

            <p>I call keep_alive() in the void loop (40 sec). Still getting a lot of heat just like publishing once a second.</p>
<p>P.S I feel like discussing another big heat coming out of Tiny GPS G735T connected to Carloop and Electron - Not to the OBD port - Just sitting not the table. Should it be on other thread?</p>
<pre><code>long interval = 40000;

void keep_alive()
{
 long currentMillis = millis();

  if(currentMillis - previousMillis &gt; interval) {

    previousMillis = currentMillis;

     if (Particle.connected())
     {
         Particle.publish("CONNECTION"," Connected");
     }

    analogvalue = analogRead(photoresistor);
    Particle.publish("LIGHT", "Lights:" + String::format("%.2f", analogvalue), 60, PRIVATE);

  }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>I moved your post to a different topic since you’re talking about the 3rd party SIM. We can keep discussing the heat issue in the original topic.</p>
<p>Are you saying there is a pause of 40 seconds between each call of the loop() function?</p>
