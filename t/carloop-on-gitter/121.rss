            <p>That’s an interesting thought. I prefer the Discourse format better to post links and projects (with pics) that might not be 100% related to one of our Github repos.</p>
<p>Having said that, it might be useful as we try to build data dictionaries or discuss very specific commits related to a repo.</p>
<p>We have a Carloop lobby but it’s empty since most people ask questions here.  I would vote to keep the conversation here since you’ll get the most exposure. I’m open, though.</p>

            <p>Yeah, i really like gitter, its like a realtime forum, works really well across time-zones too but a little less “clunky” to post. I have 4 or 5 really active groups in there (mainly meteor, node js related things). I personally tend to find that topics are more conversations than just posts. The other big advantage is the integration with github. I really like your forum here, which im guessing is Discourse? Just wondered if anyone else was on gitter also.</p>

            <p>Personally I prefer the forum format because not everybody is on the same time zone. Have you had a good experience using Gitter?</p>
