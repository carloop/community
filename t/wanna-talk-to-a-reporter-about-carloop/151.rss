    <title>Wanna talk to a reporter about Carloop?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/wanna-talk-to-a-reporter-about-carloop/151</link>
    <description>Hey folks,

I&#39;m a freelance reporter named Jon Christian, over in Boston. I ran into Alan at Maker Faire this year, and I was struck by what an interesting and potentially huge concept Carloop is, especially after he kindly answered some of my rather dumb questions. 

Anyway, I&#39;d be really interested to hear about whatever you&#39;re working on, regardless of whether it&#39;s a huge ambitious project or you&#39;re just starting out or messing around. Feel free to reply here, or shoot me an email at jonathan (dot) a (dot) christian (at) gmail (dot) com.

Cheers,

JC</description>
