    <title>Is this project still alive? Which device to pick?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/is-this-project-still-alive-which-device-to-pick/1350</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;d love to buy a carloop device but everything is sold out in the store.

And on the github page, there&#39;s a link to OSH park to order one but it&#39;s the v2.1 version while the current seems to be v2.3. So which one should I take if I want to build one myself?

I also see Particle released a Photon 2. Will there be a new release for that?

Cheers,
Matt</description>
