    <title>Does Carloop work with Boron LTE Kit?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/does-carloop-work-with-boron-lte-kit/922</link>
    <description>This is my first time hacking OBD2 - making a dashboard to my RV, does boron lte work or should i get the particle-electron 3g version?

Thanks for the help!</description>

            <p>Here is an option <a href="https://community.particle.io/t/what-are-the-current-options-for-supporting-bluetooth-low-energy-ble/23395" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">What are the current options for supporting Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)? - Hardware - Particle</a><br>
since electron does not have hardware capibilities you have to attach an external device and wire it correctly and make sure the voltage load is right. I would recommend it is worth spending money and upgrade the hardware to Wake on Bluetooth LE data (BLE). Only available on Gen 3 platforms (Argon, Boron, B Series SoM, and Tracker SoM).<a href="https://blog.particle.io/get-started-with-ble-and-nfc/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Here’s how to share data from Particle Gen 3 devices using Bluetooth or NFC – Particle Blog</a></p>

            <p>I have the Electron connected to the Carloop board and sending data over the cell network. How do I add bluetooth to it to read my wireless sensors?</p>

            <p>The only boards currently supported are the Electron, Photon and Redbear Duo. You can buy a regular Carloop (<a href="https://store.carloop.io/products/carloop" class="inline-onebox">Carloop Particle Adapter for OBD II</a>), and separately purchase an Electron from Particle.  That is equivalent to Carloop 3G (which is currently out of stock as a kit).</p>
<p>If you’d like GPS capability, you can purchase Carloop Pro which comes with the Electron + GPS and SD card reader.</p>
