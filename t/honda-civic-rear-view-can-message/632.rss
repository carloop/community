    <description>Has anyone had any luck finding a CAN message to enable the rear view camera? I&#39;d like to be able to enable it while driving and use it as an alternative to the rear view mirror.</description>

<p>You might have better luck finding an answer like this in a Honda-specific forum.<br>
Controlling the camera and the display could be done by CAN messages or there are lots of other ways it could possibly be done.  You will need to find something specific to your car; you probably will have to search for a solution that matches the model and year of your car, in addition to it being a Honda.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider when doing this is the legality of failing to check the rear-view mirror and whether this would be an acceptable means.  In many cases, these cameras are aimed low and do not give a sufficient range.</p>
