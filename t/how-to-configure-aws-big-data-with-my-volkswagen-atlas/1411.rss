    <title>How to Configure AWS Big Data with My Volkswagen Atlas?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/how-to-configure-aws-big-data-with-my-volkswagen-atlas/1411</link>
    <description>Hey everyone,

I am diving into a new project where I am trying to set up my Volkswagen Atlas (2019 model) to send data directly to AWS for storage and analysis. As I have seen many people using this in my surrounding. I’ve got Carloop up and running, and now I am looking to leverage AWS Big Data tools to collect and analyze all the information from my car.

I was doing research about the same I came across these resources/articles https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/volkswagen-group-case-study/ [what is AWS big data?](https://www.igmguru.com/blog/what-is-aws-big-data), however, they are information but I wanted to learn from community members.

Has anyone here done something similar? I’m particularly interested in any tips on configuring the data pipeline from Carloop to AWS, and what services you’d recommend for real-time processing and long-term storage. Any pitfalls to avoid or best practices to follow would be awesome to know.

Thanks in advance for the help!

Best Regards,</description>
