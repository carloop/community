    <title>Carloop meetups? Starting with Montreal?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/carloop-meetups-starting-with-montreal/253</link>
    <description>I just received my shiny new Carloop and was wondering if there were other Carloopers in the area. It would be interesting to meet up periodically to exchange in person.

I have no idea of the geographical distribution of all of you... Perhaps one of the founders could comment here based on shipments of the devices?

In any case, I&#39;ll throw the first bottle out into the ocean. I&#39;m in Montreal and would be glad to help organize something. If you&#39;re in the area, drop me a note.

It may be short notice, but if anyone from the Montreal area is reading this in the next few days, there&#39;s already a &quot;Hack and tell&quot; event scheduled for this Wednesday April 12th on the theme of Transport/Travel -- ideal for a little show &amp; tell of what you&#39;ve done so far with Carloop! It&#39;s still open to new presenters: https://www.meetup.com/Montreal-Hack-and-Tell/</description>

            <p>For info, though there was not much to “show &amp; tell” at this point other than a mod of a sample app on the <a href="http://build.particle.io" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">build.particle.io</a> IDE, everyone at the Hack&amp;Tell meetup was quite intrigued by the kit I showed and described. There could be potential for a little community of hackers playing away with this! Do you guys have a special demo rate or some sponsored devices we could request by any chance? It would be interesting to see what creative things would come from having a critical mass of developers nearby tinkering away…</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://community.carloop.io/u/jmb">@jmb</a>,  Good idea!</p>
<p>The founders of carloop appear to be in Silicon Valley, so not close to us.</p>
<p>However, I am in the Ottawa area, so not really that far from you.<br>
I have been working on modifying carloop, which I am nicknaming CarloopRetro, to include K-Line (ISO 9141 &amp; KWP 2000) in addition to the CANbus.</p>
<p>Aside from carlooping, I keep contacts with MCO (Motorsport Club of Ottawa).  I suggest you could also look into SMCC (the motorsport club in the Montreal area).</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
