    <description>What GEN3 hardware changes are you seeing here in Q1 of 2019 that are causing it to be not stable enough to develop a new Carloop module for?   

I ran across a [featherwing CAN adapter](https://easyeda.com/armin.von_collrepp/Adafruit_CAN_FeatherWing-0YRL3lfxP) the other day that looks pretty compelling.</description>

            <p>I’m aware of the microcontroller change from Photon to Gen3 devices that lack a CAN interface. I guess I was more wondering why it was stated the GEN3 hardware was still in flux. From all I can tell, it’s pretty frozen, it’s just firmware tweaking at this point (mid Feb 2019).</p>
<p>I agree the major development effort for carloop would be the new firmware required since the GEN3 solution requires an external CAN controller.</p>

<p>I moved your question to a new topic, since it did not really fit in with the other thread where it was originally posted.</p>
<p>Now for the answer:<br>
The most significant change affecting Carloop with the Gen3 is the microprocessor hardware.<br>
Gen3 hardware use a Nordic nRF52840 microprocessor which has <strong>no</strong> built-in support for CANbus.<br>
The existing Electron, Photon and RedbearDuo all use the ST micro STM32F205 microprocessor which does have built-in support for CANbus.</p>
<p>So, it is not at all a matter of stability, but a matter of using different hardware for the CAN interface and developing the lower-level firmware to support CANbus.  I do not have any word from Carloop to indicate if they are or are not planning a Gen3 version of Carloop.</p>
<p>By the way, that CAN featherwing looks like it would do the hardware side okay.  It is missing the OBD2 connector and I am not sure if it includes an automotive power regulator.  It uses a MCP2515 CAN driver, which I think is an older version which may not support CAN-FD.  Depending on your needs, it might be okay or you might want to look for something a bit more modern.  It does not solve the lack of low-level firmware, so it is only a partial solution.</p>
