    <title>Carloop is Retired</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/carloop-is-retired/1393</link>
    <description>Back in 2016, we introduced Carloop, a 100% open-source development kit designed to connect cars to the cloud, supporting applications like GPS tracking, mileage logging, and diagnostic trouble code decoding. Since then, a vibrant community of passionate developers and enthusiasts came on a journey with us to open the secrets of modern cars.

This journey is coming to an end. We are retiring the Carloop hardware. Rest assured that your existing hardware will continue working.

&gt; **The last Carloop units are available for a fire sale at https://store.carloop.io while supplies last.**

We will also keep this forum and our GitHub repository at https://github.com/carloop active as a sign of our commitment to the community. As passionate hackers, we encourage you to connect with us on LinkedIn or X (Formerly Twitter).
