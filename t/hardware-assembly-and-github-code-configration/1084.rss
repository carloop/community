    <title>Hardware assembly and github code configration</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/hardware-assembly-and-github-code-configration/1084</link>
    <description>Hello, I wanted to buy the basic but they are sold out So my next best option is buy carloop without the photon. I already have the photon and know how to download and extract the github code
How long does it take to configure the Carloop to get it all up and running? Is there a video or tutorial on it. I was not able to find anything here https://carloop.readme.io/docs Is is possible to download a third-party App from Apple Store that does OBD2 scanning as the one on the https://www.carloop.io/apps/ are very basic like mileage reader and code scanner

Here is what I am looking for in a ODB2 scanner
1. Read diagnostic trouble codes, both generic and manufacturer-specific, and display their meaning (over 3000 generic code definitions in the database).
2. Clear trouble codes and turn off the MIL (&quot;Check Engine&quot; light)
3. Display current sensor data, including:
4. Engine RPM
5. Calculated Load Value
6. Coolant Temperature
7. Fuel System Status
8. Vehicle Speed
9. Short Term Fuel Trim
10. Long Term Fuel Trim
11. Intake Manifold Pressure
12. Timing Advance
13. Intake Air Temperature
15. Air Flow Rate
16. Absolute Throttle Position
17. Oxygen sensor voltages/associated short term fuel trims
18. Fuel System status
19. Fuel Pressure

And save that on an SD Card in CSV format 
And I have Kia Rio 2002 Model so not all Hardware in the Market support it</description>
