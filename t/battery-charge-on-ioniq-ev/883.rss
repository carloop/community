    <title>Battery charge % on Ioniq EV</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/battery-charge-on-ioniq-ev/883</link>
    <description>Hey,

This will be my first car interfacing project so far. My plan is to be able to remotely monitor the battery percentage on my Hyundai Ioniq EV.

1)Has anybody ever tried to do such a thing? I know it&#39;s possible since  there is another project out there called EVNotify that uses off the shelf OBD2 dongles and with a custom android app, reads battery %

2)Is it possible I mess up my car trying to &quot;read&quot; data through OBD2 ? (read about people getting check engine lights once they plugged the photon in. )</description>

            <p>Hi, anyone succeeded? I am just about to order this, but it’s out of stock now, but it is time to be prepared.<br>
I hope I can somehow monitor charging remotely.<br>
I have already experienced unexpected disconnections which I would like to avoid in the future.<br>
My idea is to have an OBD2 device which can send notification about SoC.<br>
I tried EVnotify app with bluetooth OBD2 adapter, but it just needs to many devices I would like to have the same solution with less devices and to be more automatic, without starting/connecting anything.</p>

            <p>Hello guys,<br>
I am struggling with the same thing…Have you made any progress reading the SoC of ioniq-ev<br>
I would appreciate any help<br>
Thanks</p>

            <p>My current plan was to get the PID code from EVNotify. The guy got the SoC working with bluetooth obd2 dongles so surely Carloop would be able to use the method.</p>

            <p>Hey Clusty</p>
<p>I’m working on the same challenge. So far I haven’t been able to get the SoC (state of charge), but I think I’m very close.<br>
I’m following mainly the discussion on this topic: <a href="https://github.com/JejuSoul/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/issues/7" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/JejuSoul/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/issues/7</a><br>
It is important to know that the CAN rate is 500kbit/s and uses the ISO 15765-2 standar. That means that the reply from the system is going to be in several CAN packets. Jvanier has writen about it in the VIN reader <a href="https://carloop.dyndns.org/t/how-to-request-vin/153/4">https://carloop.dyndns.org/t/how-to-request-vin/153/4</a>. I’m planning in using that an his VIN-reader example app to get the SOC, and using the PID and ID from <a href="https://github.com/JejuSoul/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/tree/master/Ioniq%20EV" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/JejuSoul/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/tree/master/Ioniq%20EV</a></p>
<p>I hope that this helps you, maybe we can support us mutually. Let me know how you do!</p>
