    <title>Stronger antenna for Carloop</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/stronger-antenna-for-carloop/276</link>
    <description>I drive to the edge of cell service quite a bit. I&#39;ve been moving the antenna around a lot to try to get the best signal. Is it possible to get an antenna with a longer wire, so that it can be placed in a more ideal area. Most of the underbody where OBD connectors are seem to be very good at blocking GSM signal</description>
