    <title>Is SwiftUI a compatible language with CarLoop OBD-II device</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/is-swiftui-a-compatible-language-with-carloop-obd-ii-device/1322</link>
    <description>I am just curious if I can code using the SwiftUI language and have everything still work as intended with the OBD-II communication device? I&#39;m currently in school and want to do my final project on over the air vehicle diagnostic and communication. Does anyone know if this is something that I&#39;m able to do and if so, do you have any tips for me getting into it?</description>
