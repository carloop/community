    <title>Can you run a node server on particle?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/can-you-run-a-node-server-on-particle/289</link>
    <description>hey all,

i&#39;m trying to use carloop as an ODBII reader to monitor a vehicle being towed with its engine running.  I&#39;ll skip the details on this, but trust me when I say there are very good reasons for this.

Some of the areas I tow the vehicle do not have cell service so none of the data coming from carhop can go through the cloud.

I&#39;m trying to setup a local web server i can stream data from particle over my own local network. 

Would love a pointer in the right direction.  I saw this thread: https://carloop.dyndns.org/t/turn-your-carloop-into-a-remote-obd-ii-reader/93

But i&#39;m not sure how to upload .html and .js files using the particle IDE</description>
