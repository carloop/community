    <title>Carloop RedBear Duo Help</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/carloop-redbear-duo-help/753</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve recently purchased the Carloop RedBear Duo and I&#39;m having trouble finding support for this setup.  I see many posts on the photon and electron, but not the redbear.  I guess the first issue I need to get past is that fact that I&#39;m not able to flash my device via the Particle Web UI.  I also can&#39;t find out what internal IP the device has.  The Particle Web UI shows that my device has my external IP, but not my internal one.  I&#39;m really struggling to find out what&#39;s going on with this device.  I&#39;m close, but need a little guidance from a generous person who is working with the redbear.</description>

<p>Ah, now I understand your question from the other thread …</p>
<p>The RedbearDuo works just fine in the Particle environment.  I have one myself and it works fine.<br>
The one thing you cannot do in the Particle environment is to update the system firmware on the Duo; you have to do that through the files in the Duo github repository.</p>
<p>The part you are probably missing are the instructions to setup and claim the RedbearDuo to your Particle account.  I found this step was tricky and the Redbear app does not match its documentation.  I had to try it a few times before it worked.</p>
<p>The instructions are here:</p><aside class="onebox githubblob" data-onebox-src="https://github.com/redbear/Duo/blob/master/README.md">

The most important one is the tutorial named “Out of box experience”.</p>
<p>The more detailed answer is that RedbearLabs used the P1 module from Particle when they developed the Duo.  Recently, Particle bought the RedbearDuo from Redbear Labs.<br>

  <p>Hey there folks – following back up here. The work was prepped earlier this year but didn’t make it up to the Web IDE as a result of the development activity around Mesh.  We now have a plan to get the work pushed to our production environment...</p>

<p>It looks hopeful that Particle is going to provide better support for the Duo than Redbear labs was doing.  I have my fingers crossed now that Particle Mesh is done and they should have more time now to look at the Duo.</p>
