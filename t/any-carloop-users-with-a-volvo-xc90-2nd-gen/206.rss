    <title>Any Carloop Users with a Volvo XC90 (2nd gen)?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/any-carloop-users-with-a-volvo-xc90-2nd-gen/206</link>
    <description>I am a new owner of a 2017 Volvo XC90 and have had some issues with battery drain from the systems. The dealer has been helpful, but the issues remain and I would like some insight into the complex software on this vehicle. I thought Carloop might be an option, but would like to know if there are others who may have done some development on this vehicle using the platform. Thanks in advance. Jon</description>
