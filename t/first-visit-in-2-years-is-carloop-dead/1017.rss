    <title>First Visit in 2 years... is carloop dead?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/first-visit-in-2-years-is-carloop-dead/1017</link>
    <description>So this is my first visit in 2 years.  Got moved onto other projects and only recently picked back up on some of my vehicle telemetry work since we are all in COVID-19 lockdown.  So it looks to me like the Carloop product(s) and community are basically dead at this point?  None of the next generation of carloop products every came out?</description>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://community.carloop.io/u/spencer">@spencer</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://community.carloop.io/u/louisianimal">@Louisianimal</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://community.carloop.io/u/jerseytechguy">@JerseyTechGuy</a>,<br>
We’re still here!  Carloop development of the next generation was put on hold due to family and daytime job.  The Carloop community is still alive (through this forum), and I’d love to know how I can help to rekindle it.  How do you suggest we restart the momentum?</p>

            <p>Does anyone know what happened? I just found this site like a month ago and I was wondering this as well. I tried reaching out to Julien and Alan but I haven’t heard a response.</p>
