    <description>Hey everyone my name is Adi and I am just getting into the CAN hacking space, it’s a really awesome thing going on here. I see that the particle photon series of boards is now discontinued and argon is set to be discontinued on their site. Are carloop units still being produced or am I too late to the party? Again much love to this community and any help/advice is appreciated!</description>
