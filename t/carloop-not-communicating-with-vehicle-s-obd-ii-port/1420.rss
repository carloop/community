    <title>Carloop Not Communicating with Vehicle’s OBD-II Port</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/carloop-not-communicating-with-vehicle-s-obd-ii-port/1420</link>
    <description>Hello

I recently set up my Carloop device and followed the initial setup guide; but I’m having trouble getting it to communicate with my vehicle’s OBD-II port. :upside_down_face:

The device powers on correctly when plugged in, and I can connect it to my computer, but I’m not receiving any data from the car’s ECU. I’ve tried using different vehicles to rule out compatibility issues, but the problem persists. :upside_down_face:

I have double-checked my connections and verified that the CAN library is correctly installed. I’ve also attempted to send basic requests to the OBD-II system but am not getting any response. Could this be due to specific vehicle manufacturer restrictions / is there a common troubleshooting step I might be missing? :thinking: I have checked https://carloop.dyndns.org/c/getting-started/5 [Azure](https://www.igmguru.com/cloud-computing/microsoft-azure-solution-architect-az-300-training) guide for reference . 

Has anyone else encountered this issue when getting started with Carloop? I’d appreciate any advice on debugging this connection issue and ensuring that my setup is correctly configured. 

Thanks in advance! :slightly_smiling_face:</description>
