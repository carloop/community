    <title>Differences between CAN Hitch and Carloop OBD Adapter?</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/differences-between-can-hitch-and-carloop-obd-adapter/671</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just wondering the differences between the can hitch and the OBD Adapter. I have both of them and I noticed that the same code and the same car, I&#39;m missing messages (or not receiving) using the can hitch. Also, comparing the schematics, I noticed that has different components.

Is there any notable difference?</description>
