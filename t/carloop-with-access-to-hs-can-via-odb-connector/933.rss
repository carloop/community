    <title>Carloop with access to HS CAN via ODB connector</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/carloop-with-access-to-hs-can-via-odb-connector/933</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m new to carloop - just started to plug a carloop with photon into my ODB port and read a CAN trace.
That all works fine!
I wonder if the carloop hardware can connect to and of the other CAN pins of the OBD connector.
My vehicle (Volvo V60) has HS-CAN and LS-CAN pins. It there a jumper or software switch that I can change to connect the carloop device to the HS-CAN?

Thanks!</description>
