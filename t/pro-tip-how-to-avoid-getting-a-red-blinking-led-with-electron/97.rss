    <title>PRO TIP: How to avoid getting a red blinking LED with Electron</title>
    <link>https://community.carloop.io/t/pro-tip-how-to-avoid-getting-a-red-blinking-led-with-electron/97</link>
    <description>For those of you using the Electron with Carloop, you might have noticed that you can power it straight from the OBD-II port without the LiPo battery and it&#39;ll work just fine.  There is one annoying detail which is a blinking red LED.  This is caused by a pull-up resistor.  Luckily it is very easy to remove and it won&#39;t compromise your Electron.  To remove it, just unsolder the resistor circled in blue and you&#39;re good to go!
