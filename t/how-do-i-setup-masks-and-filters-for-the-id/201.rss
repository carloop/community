    <description>How do I setup Masks and Filters for the CAN ID ? The sequence I would like to implement would look like this using the ELM AT format.

ATCFxxx
ATCMyyy
ATMA

Setup filter and mask xxx &amp; yyy on the 11 bit Message ID then enable the CAN hardware to pass only those frames that match that pattern to my app. Also how do I stop this monitor mode?

How many filter/mask pairs does the STM32F205 support?

Update:I have found the Particle documentation for CAN so I think that is what I need to read.</description>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://community.carloop.io/u/turbo3">@Turbo3</a>,<br>
Welcome to the Carloop community! There are many ways to filter CAN messages.  Here is some sample code that might help although it is not in the ELM AT format: <a href="https://github.com/carloop/app-simple-transmit/blob/master/src/app-simple-transmit.cpp" class="inline-onebox">app-simple-transmit/src/app-simple-transmit.cpp at master · carloop/app-simple-transmit · GitHub</a></p>
<p>Is this helpful or did I miss your question completely?</p>
