          <title>Troubleshooting Stepper Motor Issues with Blackbox X32 in CNC Setup</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi everyone, <img src="https://carloop.dyndns.org/images/emoji/twitter/saluting_face.png?v=12" title=":saluting_face:" class="emoji" alt=":saluting_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I was recently working on a CNC project and using a Blackbox X32 controller along with Nema 23 stepper motors. I’m experiencing some issues with the setup and could use some advice from those who have experience with similar configurations.<br>
Here are the specifics of my setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blackbox X32 controller</li>
<li>Nema 23 stepper motors</li>
</ul>
<p>But I am facing some specific issues like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes the motors skip steps or move erratically.</li>
<li>The motors and controller seem to get quite hot after a short period of operation.</li>
<li>There’s a lot of noise from the motors during operation, which I suspect might be due to improper tuning.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have tried adjusting the current settings on the Blackbox X32 and checking all connections, but the problems persist. Has anyone else encountered similar issues or have any tips on how to resolve them? Are there specific settings or configurations I should be aware of for this setup?</p>
<p>Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>Was finally able to setup my carloop with particle photon.<br>
First carloop was defective and had to replace.  Now the replacement is working.</p>
<p>Hello world LED blinking works<br>
VIN Reader works</p>
<p>Followed all of the instructions here: <a href="https://www.carloop.io/apps/app-socketcan/">https://www.carloop.io/apps/app-socketcan/</a></p>
<p>Problem comes when running candump can0</p>
<p>On my 2018 Nissan, 64 lines of output come right when turning on the ignition, then nothing else.  All of the IDs are 71D 72D 71F 72F.</p>
<p>On my 2012 Nissan, constant output is received as expected.</p>
<p>Per this website (at the bottom <a href="https://harrisonsand.com/can-on-the-raspberry-pi/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://harrisonsand.com/posts/can-on-the-raspberry-pi/</a>) it looks like there could be a gateway / firewall in my vehicle preventing code output?</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I have the <a href="https://store.carloop.io/products/carloop-pro-1">Carloop Pro</a> and 'm having troubles getting a GPS fix simliar to that of many other threads here. I’m running the unedited <a href="https://github.com/carloop/carloop-library/blob/master/examples/carloop_minimal/carloop_minimal.cpp" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">carloop-minimal</a> code on OS 1.4.0 and despite being outside on a clear day for 30 minutes, I can’t aquire a GPS status.</p>
<p>It seems like using an external antenna or using jumper wires on the JST-SH ports wouldn’t be optimal for my situation. Are there any other easy ways to debug this? How can I tell if the boards are bad? Any direction is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hardware: Electron with Carloop GPS/CAN<br>
Particle OS: 1.2.1rc2</p>
<p>I have a very basic test app that enables GPS and spews its output to serial. However, I am seeing repeated frame errors in the output, like in the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$GNRMC,,V,,,,,,,,,,N*4D
$GNVTG,,,,,,,,,N*2E
$GNGGA,,,,,,0,00,99.99,,,,,,*56

$GNGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,99.99,99.99,99.99*2E
$GPGSV,1,1,00*79
$GLGSV,1,1,00*65
$GNGLL,,,,,,V,N*7A
$GNTXT,01,01,01,More than 100 frame errors, UART RX was disabled*70
$GNRMC,,V,,,,,,,,,,N*4D
$GNVTG,,,,,,,,,N*2E
$GNGGA,,,,,,0,00,99.99,,,,,,*56
$GNGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,99.99,99.99,99.99*2E
</code></pre>
<p>Am I doing something wrong, or is this a known issue? Does this impact behavior/performance? I’m also not able to ever get a GPS fix — I’ve even tried letting it run outside for a couple of hours with no luck.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

            <p>I have an electron connected to my carloop. I’m not able to read any CAN data. The red LED lights up when I have it connected to the OBDII port, and I can connect to the the electron, but it doesn’t seem to read any data from any of my cars. I tried the example VIN reader app, and it couldn’t even do that. I upgraded the device OS from 0.5.4 to 1.1.0</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I have a Carloop with the GPS module. At times it gets a fix very quickly when there is open sky at other times it never gets a fix. The question I have is would it be possible to program the Carloop to retry the gps connection until a fix is obtained?<br>
Thanks!</p>

            <p>I have 2 wifi Photon OBD2 dongles that send CAN data to an IP address that I can check on my phone or tablet. Previously both Photons would connect to the wifi hotspot on my verizon cell phone. I had an iphone 6. It worked well.</p>
<p>I finally upgraded and got a new iphone xs. I tried to connect the two Photons and they wont connect to the new wifi of the iphone xs. I took my sim card out of my phone and plugged into my verizon ready ipad (its not currently activated with its own service), went through the set up process, and the Photons connected no problem.</p>
<p>So it definitely has something to do with the new A2 security in the new iphone xs. Any ideas? I could sign up the ipad with its own Verizon service but thats another $20 a month! Id prefer not to spend that when I already have it on the iphone.</p>

            <p>I’m testing my sketch in 3 different cars :</p>
<ul>
<li>Seat Toledo 2015</li>
<li>Mazda 3 2015</li>
<li>Hyundai elantra 2017</li>
</ul>
<p>And I have consistent data in the Seat toledo (meaning that the data I ask for, the data I got from the car - RPM, Speed, Module Voltage-), but when I test the same sketch on the Mazda and Toledo, most of the time the cars doesn’t give me the data I asked (few times the car gives me the module voltage, or the speed, and ALWAYS the RPMS).</p>
<p>I  changed the timing between the send and receive function, and the behaviour is almost the same in the Mazda and Hyundai.</p>
<p>My sketch is :</p>
<pre><code>SYSTEM_MODE(SEMI_AUTOMATIC);
SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED);

int VEHICLE_SPEED = 0;
float CONTROL_MODULE_VOLTAGE = 0;

void setup() {
    
    Serial.begin(9600);    
    
    carloop.begin();

    maxUnreadMessage = sizeof(PIDS);

    parseConfig();    
}

void loop() {
    carloop.update();
    sendObdRequest();
    
    delay(100);
    
    waitForObdResponse();
}

    }

    currentPid = PIDS[currentPidIndex];
    currentPidIndex++;

    message.data[2] = currentPid;//This is the data we want to ask to the car
    carloop.can().transmit(message);

}

    }

    if (data[2] == 13) {
        VEHICLE_SPEED =(int) data[3];
    }

    if (data[2] == 66) {
        CONTROL_MODULE_VOLTAGE = (256 * data[3] + data[4])/1000;
    }    
}
</code></pre>
<p>Any ideas ? I’m changed the delay(100) to delay(1000) (and some values in between) and I got better results, but not consistent results yet.</p>
<p>Is there any issue I have to consider in terms of timing between send/receive responses?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

          <title>Car stops responding after a few seconds for packet transmission</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Guys,<br>
I’m having an odd issue which i couldn’t find a useful solution or reason for.<br>
I’m connected directly to my canbus to the OBD 2.<br>
I’m getting canbus traffic and everything works well.</p>
<p>After i figured out the can id for my RPM, i performed a replay attack with socketCan.<br>
The attack worked and the RPM did respond, but only for a second or less, and than stopped.<br>
Another attempt was failed, and the RPM didn’t respond at all. The only way to make it respond again was to unplug my connection, plug it back, and reconfigure the can0 interface for socket can.</p>
<p>Details:<br>
Car: Kia Picanto 2017<br>
Hardware: Cantact v1.0<br>
Software: SocketCan - can utils<br>
Running:<br>
<strong>“while true; do cansend can0 316#4532F53D322F007F; sleep 0.002; done”</strong></p>
<p>Also because i transmit a lot of packets, i increased my kernel queue buffer:<br>
<strong>sudo ifconfig can0 txqueuelen 10000</strong></p>
<p>Anybody familiar with this issue? or what cause it? any solutions found?<br>
Or maybe did i miss something on my experiment?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!<br>
Snir</p>

<p>To upgrade your application running in the Particle Web IDE <a href="https://build.particle.io/libs/carloop/2.1.0/tab/carloop.cpp">open the Carloop library version 2.1.0</a>, click Include in project and select your application.</p>
<p>To upgrade your application built with the Particle CLI, run <code>particle library add carloop</code></p>
<p>To get your Photon or Electron back online if it’s in a loop of booting, connecting to the cloud then blinking red and crashing, <strong>hold the SETUP button, tap RESET and let go of SETUP.</strong> The device will connect to the Particle Cloud and start breathing magenta instead of cyan. This is called Safe mode. You will then be able to flash your application that includes the fixed version of the library.</p>
<h3><a name="original-thread-2" class="anchor" href="https://community.carloop.io#original-thread-2"></a>Original thread</h3>
<p>With the release of Particle firmware 0.7.0 for the Photon and Electron the Carloop library started crashing in the <code>begin()</code> method.</p>
<p>I’ll document how I’m investigating the issue in this thread.</p>

            <p>This is a simple issue and I know that you guys are reading the speed properly.</p>
<p>I’m trying to read the speed but I never get a speed higher than 70 Km/h . I did a 2 hours trip on a highway, and I expected to get a higher speed (I was reading the panel to see the “average” speed I was driving) with no luck.</p>
<p>This is how I read/parse the speed</p>
<p><code>int VEHICLE_SPEED =(int) data[3];</code></p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong ?</p>

            <p>I flashed my particle photon with carloop code from the particle library today, hooked it up to the ODB port on my land rover and the photon smoked immediately.  Everything I have read says that there should be regulation in both the carloop PCB and the photon but evidently that regulation wasn’t enough to protect from the voltage coming out of the port. I just bought the car and it is a 2002 - I’m wondering if the ODB port is a custom install and wired incorrectly - any ideas on where to start? I guess measuring the 12V supply would be a good start? Any other thoughts?</p>

<p>The thing is that is not reading messages et all. Is there a way to diagnose why the electron is not receiving any message?</p>
<p>BTW: I have two photon with the same sketch and they are reading messages from the can bus with (as far) no problems.</p>

<p>Up until now I’ve only bee playing with the Photon functionaility and have been able to get what I am looking for from this.</p>
<p>I am now moving onto the Carloop section and this is where i’m struggling. When trying to read any data from the carloop from my app I don’t get any response back at all.</p>
<p>I uploaded my source code to: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jnymris/carloop/src" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">BitBucket/jnymris/carloop</a></p>
<p>I’ve tried to add as much debugging as possible and I can see it appears to get this far:</p>
<p>(Line 101)  Particle.publish(“Debug/Status/readVIN()”,“starting”);</p>
<p>But does not appear to reach any further. Using the (<a href="https://www.carloop.io/apps/app-vin-reader/">Vin Reader App</a> this appears to pull it successfully?</p>
<p>Any suggestions as to where i am going wrong?</p>

            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Running into some issues with carloop draining my battery… I perform some safety checks in the code and have logged the number of times the device goes into deep sleep based on battery voltage (after calling carloop.update of course) throughout the course of an evening. Everything is as expected compared to my sleep duration.</p>
<p>I do have a gps connected as well as a micro sd card reader. Is there a chance that either one of these devices is draining my battery over the course of 2 days?</p>
<p>EDIT - I just looked up the current draw of the gp-735 module. 37ma. Seems likely that if this is continuously powered then it could pull my battery down over the weekend. Any way to put the GPS module to sleep or switch the power to the jst pin?</p>

            <p>Had the carloop and photon connected to a Nissan 350z and the the Engine SOL fuse blew.<br>
The car was off, the ignition key was inserted which started can traffic, then the clutch was depressed mutilple times while off and then the can messages stopped.<br>
Not sure why the Engine SOL fuse would blow because of this.</p>

            <p>Hi, I can’t get the electron to activate when I type in the Sim I’d, it stays like it is trying to but never does.</p>
<p>When connected to a raspberry pi via USB running raspbian I can’t get the connection to show up when checking with ls /dev/ttyACM* after installing can-utils … I get the error ls: cannot access /dev/ttyACM*:. No such file or directory</p>

          <title>Not transmitting CAN messages [SOLVED]</title>

            <p>I have a Raspberry Pi 3 in my 2016 Jeep Rubicon Hard Rock with a PiCAN2 Hat spliced in the CAN behind the radio and it’s working fine. The RPi3 is acting as a wireless hotspot and a webserver in addition to a few other things. So that I can connect my phone to the Pi and pull up a webpage I made to and click a link to read/write to/from the CAN bus. I can read the status of the doors, control the windshield wipers, blinkers, etc.</p>
<p>I purchased Carloop with the RedBear Duo from MassDrop. I’ve added the ReadBear to my particle account and flashed the “minimal transmit” sketch. I can run cansniffer on the Pi3 and never see the Carloop transmit anything to CAN. I initially thought it was something with the RedBear, so I swapped it out with a Photon soldered to the battery shield I use for testing. Same issue! Whatever I transmit never comes across.</p>
<p>I thought maybe the Pi3 is interfering with the Carloop? I changed the code on the minimal transmit sketch to control the left blinker, so that I could disconnect the Pi3 and have a visual indication. I know that CAN message works because I am able to use it on the Pi3, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>I have been playing with CAN for a while with the Pi3, I work on PLCs for a living, I have a programming background, but I don’t understand what I’m missing… I read through the getting started section, and the rest of the community, seems pretty straight forward. Any thoughts?</p>
